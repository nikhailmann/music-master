# music-master
music master is a web application that employs the spotify web-api's client credentials flow in order to create a game in which the user must predict which of two artists from a various assortment of genres has a higher-rated "popularity" index (a score of 0-100) provided by the Spotify API. 

NOTE: as of 11/27/2024, the original API endpoints this was designed on are deprecated. See this link: https://developer.spotify.com/blog/2024-11-27-changes-to-the-web-api. I have made the application work again without breaking, though the intended functionality may still be lacking.
